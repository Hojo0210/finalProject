## Topic: Florida Housing Market & The Deciding Factors in Purchasing, Relocation, and Population Growth

# Hypothesis: 
We believe that there are several specific factors that determine how and why people choose to relocate to and within Florida. Our goal is to use those metrics to predict which counties and areas have the most potential for future growth.

# Data Sources: 
Currently, our focus has been on deciding how to align and leverage US Census data, various web-based real estate sites, NOAA, Bureau of Labor and Statistics, and Florida Employment data. This list will grow and change as the data capabilities become clearer.

# Questions:
    * What are the main drivers of population growth in Florida?
	* Can we use those drivers to predict where growth will happen in the future?
    * of these drivers, are there any that best predict when and where growth will occur.
        - House Pricing
        - Unemployment Rates
        - Climate/warmer weather
