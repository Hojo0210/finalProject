## Final Project - Group D

# Topic: Florida Housing Market & The Deciding Factors in Purchasing, Relocation, and Population Growth

# Hypothesis: 
We believe that there are several specific factors that determine how and why people choose to relocate to and within Florida. Our goal is to use those metrics to predict which counties and areas have the most potential for future growth.

# Data Sources: 
Currently, our focus has been on deciding how to align and leverage US Census data, various web-based real estate sites, NOAA, Bureau of Labor and Statistics, and Florida Employment data. This list will grow and change as the data capabilities become clearer.

# Questions:
    * What are the main drivers of population growth in Florida?
	* Can we use those drivers to predict where growth will happen in the future?
    * of these drivers, are there any that best predict when and where growth will occur.
        - House Pricing
        - Unemployment Rates
        - Climate/warmer weather

# Tableau:
	* For our tableau dashboard we created a story that included 5 dashboards analyzing the following data:	
		- Home Values: 
			* Comparison and trends of total population per county in florida, along with data from High Tier, Low Tier, and Single Family Median Home values. 
			* Also with a forecast created by tableau prediciting the next ten years.
		- Employment: 
			* Comparison and trends of total population per county in florida, along with data from Labor Force, Employment, Average Yearly Wage, Unemployment, Unemployment Rate%. 
			* Also with a forecast created by tableau prediciting the next ten years.
		- Crime: 
			* Comparison and trends of total population per county in florida, along with data from multiple crime reports, and an index of crime per 1k. 			
			* also with a forecast created by tableau prediciting the next ten years.
		- Machine Learning: 
			* Comparison and trends of Average Yearly Wage, Employment, Labor Force, Population, Single Home Median Value from the Machine Learning module we created.
			* Also includes a forecast of the prediction of the next 10 years which was created using our machine learning code.
		- Forecast Comparison: 
			* Comparison between the Tableau Forecast and our Machine Learning code. detailing the similarities and differences
